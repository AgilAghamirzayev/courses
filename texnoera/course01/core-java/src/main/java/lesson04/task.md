### Task: Count the Occurrence of Each Character in a Given String

#### Problem Description:
Write a Java program that takes a string as input from the user and counts the frequency of each character in the string. Your program should iterate through the string, calculate the number of times each character appears, and then display the results.

#### Requirements:
1. Ignore the case (treat lowercase and uppercase as the same character).
2. Consider all characters, including spaces, punctuation, and special characters.
3. Output the characters and their respective counts in any order.

#### Steps to follow:
1. Prompt the user to input a string.
2. Traverse the string to count the frequency of each character.
3. Display the frequency count for each character.

#### Example:
If the input string is:
```
"Hello World!"
```

Your program should output:
```
h -> 1
e -> 1
l -> 3
o -> 2
  -> 1
w -> 1
r -> 1
d -> 1
! -> 1
```

#### Notes:
- Remember to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters as the same (e.g., 'H' and 'h' should be counted together).

Good luck and happy coding!
