# 11 OOP PART 6:

- Polymorphism
    - Compile time polymorphism -> **overloading**
      The compiler determines which method to call based on the type and number of arguments passed to the method.
    - Runtime polymorphism -> **overriding**
    - Dynamic Method Dispatch
      When a method is called on an object, the runtime system determines which implementation of the method to use
      based on the actual type of the object, not just its declared type.
      Association, composition, and aggregation are all types of relationships between classes in object-oriented
      programming

- Association (Has a)

  Association, in general terms, refers to the relationship between any two entities. Association in java is the
  relationship that can be established between any two classes.

  These relationships can be of four types:

    * One-to-One relation (Email -> User Account)
    * One-to-many relation (Country -> City)
    * Many-to-one relation (Order -> Customer)
    * Many-to-many relation (Book -> Author)

# 12 OOP PART 7:

- Aggregation
    * has a
    * weak association
      Aggregation represents a weak relationship between two classes where one class (the whole) contains a reference to
      the other class (the part), but the part can exist independently of the whole.

- Composition
    - part-of
    - strong association
    - child does not exist independently of its parent
      Composition represents a strong relationship between two classes where one class (the composite) contains the
      other class (the component). The component cannot exist independently of the composite, and any changes to the
      composite will affect the component.

- Object class
    - Default extends
    - Methods
        - equals
            - == and equals
        - hashcode
        - toString
        -
- is-a relationship
- has-a relationship
- POJO (Plain Old Java Object)

# 15 OOP PART 9:

- Enum
    - .values()

- Java Collection
    - List
- Wrapper classes

    - valueOf()
    - Converting wrapper to primitive
    - Autoboxing, Unboxing
    - Immutable
    - Integer cache
    - performance problems with wrapper type
- Immutable class
    - The class is declared as final, so it cannot be subclassed.
    - All fields are private and final.
    - No setter methods.
    - The constructor initializes all fields.
    - If the class has mutable fields, ensure defensive copies are made when returning or accepting them.
- Record
    - Constructor
    - extends
    - Record abstract class
- var
    - limitation (cannot be global, method parameter, null, without assignment)
